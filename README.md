**Description:** The website for the Moments app, located at www.yourmoments.app

## Project Flow
The website is built with React and hosted with Vercel.  However, since I'm
trying not to pay for hosting, and hosting repoes that are on an orgranization
costs $$- to actually update the website I've connected it to my personal repo
[here](https://github.com/marinawooden/moments-website).  So, if anybody wants
to make any updates, please let me (Marina) know, and I'll get it pushed up for
you :-)
