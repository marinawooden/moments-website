**Description:** The website for the Moments app, located at www.yourmoments.app

## Project Flow
The website is first created with React.  The files for this can be found in the
`www.yourmoments` folder.  The actual files that are displayed on the website are
the products of building the app (a.k.a running `npm run build` inside of the
www.yourmoments folder).

So, every time that a change that changes the visual appearance of the website is
made, the `npm run build` command should be run, and the results of the `dist`
folder should be copied into the `public` folder.
